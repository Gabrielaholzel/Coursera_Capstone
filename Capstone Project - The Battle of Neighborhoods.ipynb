The economy in the city proper alone, measured by Gross Geographic Product (adjusted for purchasing power), totaled US \\\\$ 84.7 billion (US$34,200 per capita) in 2011 and amounts to nearly a quarter of Argentina's as a whole. These are the reasons why I believe Buenos Aires is a place with a great competition, especially, if you want to open a restaurant so I would like to help a possible stakeholder to understand better the town and the market with useful insights.\n\nTarget Audience:\n* A business entrepreneur that wants open a new restaurant in Buenos Aires.\n* Business Analyst or Data Scientists, who wish to analyze the neighborhoods of Buenos Aires using python, Jupiter notebook and some machine learning techniques.\n* Someone curious about data that want to have an idea, how beneficial it is to open a restaurant and what are the pros and cons of this business."}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "## Data <a name=\"data\"></a>"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "We will first make use of Neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires page from Wikipedia to scrap the table to create a dataframe.
